Healthcare Management has always been an important and crucial problem to solve as small mis-judgement can cause someone his life and his family a permanent loss. So it demands that we properly manage the workload in hospitals and be prepared for the future. This becomes even more necessary at a time where the entire world is facing a pandemic. 

Here, we intend to design a predictive model telling us about the approximate stay of a patient at a hospital. This will allow the hospitals to estmate the number of beds that would be available in the forthcoming days.

I got a rank of 322 out of nearly 20000 candidates.
